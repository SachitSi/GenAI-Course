## Best Practices

When crafting prompts, keep these tips in mind:

- Clearly communicate the most important information.
- Structure prompts with role, context, and instructions.
- Use specific examples to guide the model.
- Break complex tasks into simpler prompts.
- Ask the model to evaluate its own responses.

Remember that creativity and persistence are key to becoming a skilled prompt engineer. Experiment with different approaches and don't be afraid to think outside the box when formulating your prompts.
