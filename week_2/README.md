# Week 2: Prompt Engineering

Welcome to Week 2 of the Generative AI Certification Course! This week, we'll be diving into **Prompt Engineering**, a crucial technique to refine and optimize the performance of large language models (LLMs) like those we've worked with in Week 1.

The content for this week is presented and created by Vansh Sood.

## Overview of Week 2

In Week 2, you'll learn how to:

- Improve the accuracy and relevance of model outputs by crafting better input prompts.
- Experiment with different prompt formats and structures to see how they affect model performance.
- Understand the limitations of models and how to work around them by enhancing prompts.

## Contents of This Branch

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for Week 2.
- **`Lab2_GenAI_ShiftKey.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook for hands-on exercises in Prompt Engineering.
- **`RESOURCES.md`**: Additional resources for further learning and exploration on prompt engineering techniques.

## Lab 2 Overview

### Prompt Engineering: Optimizing Model Outputs

This lab will focus on using the same `Flan-T5 base` model we explored in Week 1 but with an emphasis on how modifying the input prompts can greatly affect the output.

### Key Sections Covered in Lab 2:

1. **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**: Learn the importance of prompt design.
2. **Basic Prompts**: Start by experimenting with simple prompts.
3. **Complex Prompts**: Explore more intricate prompt designs and how they influence the model's performance.
4. **Model Constraints and Prompting Strategies**: Understand the model's limitations and use strategies to enhance its responses.
5. **Comparison of Outputs**: Analyze how different prompts yield varying outputs, and draw insights on how to structure better prompts.

### How to Use This Lab:

1. Open the `Lab2.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Experiment with different prompts to see how the `Flan-T5 base` model responds.
3. Refer to `RESOURCES.md` for additional articles and tutorials on prompt engineering.
4. Make sure to run each code cell in the notebook to see the differences between various types of prompts.

## Additional Resources
