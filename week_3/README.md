# Week 3: Fine-Tuning in Generative AI

## Overview

In Week 3, we explore **fine-tuning** as a critical technique for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specific tasks or domains. Fine-tuning allows for the adaptation of pre-trained models to new data, making them more effective and accurate in delivering relevant results. We will examine various strategies and methods used for fine-tuning, along with best practices in handling domain-specific data.

## Key Topics:

- **Understanding Fine-Tuning:** The theory behind fine-tuning and why it is essential for customizing AI models to specific tasks.
- **Techniques and Approaches:** Various methods used to fine-tune models for domain-specific or task-specific purposes.
- **Practical Implementation:** Steps to fine-tune models using real-world data, including tools like Hugging Face.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Identifying common challenges when fine-tuning models and how to mitigate them.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Understand the key concepts behind fine-tuning in generative AI.
2. Implement fine-tuning techniques on large language models using tools like Hugging Face.
3. Recognize common challenges and limitations of fine-tuning.
4. Apply fine-tuning strategies to improve model performance in domain-specific tasks.
